Project Name : Geometric wars

libries/ Languages : C++ and SFML ( Simple Fast Multimedia Library )

Introduction: Geometric wars is a game created with the use of c++ and Sfml to display 2D graphics on the computer screen. we studied concepts such as game math where we 
talked about how we can simulate velocity, collision and even gravitation in 2D games 

Game play: The game includes a bunch of different shapes spawned by the computer and then a unique hallow shape which represents the player and is used to shoot white balls 
at each shape which ends up dispersing into smaller shapes before disappearing from the screen. Each shape has it's own life time on the screen and will gradually fade away
after some number of frames goes by. the controls for the player are W - move up, D- move left,  A- move right, S-move down, and right clicking on any shape on the sreen to shoot 
a white ball (in 2D) in the direction of that shape

Future_Goals: This project is more of a hands on experience of creating 2D games using graphic libaries in conjuction with c++. I plan on building this exact game 
but in 3D with a more  robost  custom  game engine
